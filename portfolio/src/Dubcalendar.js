                    <p>This project was developed in part for the Capstone course CSC: 450 Software Engineering at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. With a team size of five students, our goal was to create a social-based web application that allows students to access and analyze their peersâ€™ schedules while also providing valuable insights into course difficulty relative to the teaching professor. A working version is no longer deployed as of July 2023 due to an expired database.</p>
